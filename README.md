## 🎪 About Me

Greetings, fellow digital wanderers! I'm **Atticus Wilde** - a passionate technologist who believes that the best code is written with a cup of tea in hand and incense burning nearby. 

When I'm not crafting elegant solutions in the digital realm, you'll find me:
- 🏔️ **Conquering peaks** - because life's too short for flat ground
- 🏸 **Swinging rackets** - where every serve is a metaphor for deployment
- ♟️ **Playing chess** - because strategy is universal
- 📚 **Lost in books** - from ancient wisdom to cutting-edge tech
- 🎬 **Watching films** - where storytelling meets visual poetry
- 🍵 **Brewing tea** - because patience is a virtue in coding too
- 🕯️ **Burning incense** - for that zen developer mindset
